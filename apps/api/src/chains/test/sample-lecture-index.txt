[00:00] Segment: Introduction — concepts: Fourier series; periodic signals; captions: "In this lecture we approximate periodic signals as sums of sinusoids."

[02:15] Segment: Sine and Cosine Basis — concepts: orthogonality; basis functions; graphics: unit circle diagram; captions: "Orthogonal basis functions simplify coefficient computation."

[05:58] Segment: Period and Fundamental Frequency — concepts: period T; fundamental frequency ω0; captions: "For period T, ω0 = 2π/T."

[07:42] Segment: Coefficients — concepts: an; bn; c0; formulas: 
  an = (2/T)∫ x(t) cos(nω0 t) dt; 
  bn = (2/T)∫ x(t) sin(nω0 t) dt; 
  c0 = (1/T)∫ x(t) dt
  captions: "Coefficients project x(t) onto orthogonal sinusoids."

[10:20] Segment: Example Square Wave — concepts: odd symmetry; only sine terms; graphics: square wave plot; captions: "Only bn nonzero due to odd symmetry."

[12:10] Segment: Convergence & Gibbs Phenomenon — concepts: convergence in mean; Gibbs phenomenon; graphics: step function with overshoot; captions: "Partial sums overshoot near discontinuities (~9%)."

[15:30] Segment: Practical Notes — concepts: truncation; filtering; reconstruction; captions: "Truncating to N harmonics gives an approximation; filtering can reduce ringing."

Key Concepts:
- Fourier series: representation of periodic signals as weighted sums of sinusoids
- Orthogonality: inner products vanish between different basis functions
- Fundamental frequency (ω0 = 2π/T)
- Coefficients (an, bn, c0) via inner products/integrals
- Symmetry properties (even/odd) simplify which terms appear
- Gibbs phenomenon near discontinuities
- Truncation and reconstruction trade-offs
